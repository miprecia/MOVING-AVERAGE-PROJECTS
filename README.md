# MOVING-AVERAGE-PROJECTS

## Project Overview
Created an Auto-regressive moving average model, using 1-day and 5-day lag plots to analyze and forecast time series data.

## Description
This project implements an ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) model for time series analysis and forecasting. The model leverages lag plots at different intervals (1-day and 5-day lags) to understand temporal dependencies and patterns in the data.

## Key Features
- **AutoRegressive Model**: Captures dependencies between observations and their lagged values
- **Moving Average Component**: Incorporates past forecast errors to improve model accuracy
- **Lag Plot Analysis**: 
  - 1-day lag plots for short-term pattern detection
  - 5-day lag plots for medium-term trend analysis
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Generate predictions based on historical patterns

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Statistical modeling libraries
- Time series analysis tools
- Data visualization

## Model Components
The ARMA model combines:
1. **Autoregressive (AR)**: Uses past values to predict future values
2. **Moving Average (MA)**: Uses past forecast errors to improve predictions

## Use Cases
- Financial market forecasting
- Stock price prediction
- Trend analysis
- Demand forecasting
- Economic indicator prediction
